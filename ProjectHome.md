This project is a copy of the eAthena program with added support for 3rd jobs, RE clients, new client features, and newer systems.

The game play in this code uses the classic RO game mechanics and all the jobs (including 3rd jobs) are coded to play using these mechanics.

Note: This project WILL NOT support any renewal mechanics except for the renewal casting system for 3rd job skills and other skills made in renewal.

NOTICE: DUE TO GOOGLE CODE SHUTTING DOWN, THE PROJECT HAS BEEN MOVED TO SOURCEFORGE. YOU CAN FIND THE PROJECT'S NEW ADDRESS HERE....
